# Publisher Guide: Dedicated Email 🛠️

> **Your Role:** The Host. You introduce a partner brand to your audience using your own tone of voice.

## 1. Structure & Co-branding
* **Header:** Keep YOUR logo at the top.
* **Intro:** Contextualize. *Example: "Today, I am happy to introduce [Partner], a brand we love because..."*
* **Footer:** Keep your usual footer with the unsubscribe link.

## 2. Technical Specs (HTML)
* **Width:** 600px max container.
* **Mobile First:** Font size 14px minimum. Buttons large enough for thumbs.
* **Ratio:** Aim for 60% images / 40% text.

## 3. Tracking (CRITICAL 🚨)

### The Opening Pixel
You must insert the HTML code (pixel) provided by GetInside at the very bottom of your email, just before the `</body>` tag.

### Tracked Links
**NEVER** use the raw link of the advertiser's website.
* Use only the redirection links (`http://gtinsi.de/...`) provided in the brief.
* **Check:** Every button and clickable image must point to this tracked link.
