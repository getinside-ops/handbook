# Publisher Guide: Parcel Insert 📦

> **Your Role:** Logistics Provider. You ensure the physical distribution of the advertising asset (Flyer, sample) directly into the customer's hands.

## 1. Reception & Storage
The advertiser delivers the assets to your warehouse address (confirmed during campaign validation).

* **Quality Control:** Upon receipt, check the condition of the boxes. If goods are damaged or wet, take a photo and notify the GetInside Ops team **before** signing the delivery note.
* **Identification:** Store pallets/boxes in a dedicated "Insertion" area to avoid mixing them with your own flyers.

## 2. The Gesture (Insertion)
The campaign's success depends on the end customer's "Unboxing" experience.

* **Timing:** Insertion happens at the packing station, just before sealing the parcel.
* **Position:** The flyer must be placed **on top** of the products, face up.
    * *It must be the first thing the customer sees when opening the box.*
* **Golden Rule:** **1 Parcel = 1 Flyer.** (Unless specified otherwise). Never insert duplicates.

## 3. Monitoring & End of Campaign 🚨

You must communicate with GetInside to manage volumes.

* **Kick-off:** Confirm via email/slack the day the first flyer was inserted.
* **Low Stock:** Notify us when you estimate only 2 or 3 days of stock remaining.
* **Leftovers:** Once the campaign end date is reached, stop insertion.
    * *If < 100 units left:* Recycle.
    * *If > 100 units left:* Ask GetInside for instructions (Return or Extension).
